# About this repo

This is a collection of my teaching works based on the past live classes I teach
and tutorials.
The theme is "Rust for Bitcoiners", so the examples are created in such a way that
it is relevant to Bitcoin technology.

The purpose of the top level directories are explained below.

* [rust-for-bitcoiners-1](./rust-for-bitcoiners-1/)

This directory contains the details about first run of the live classes spanning over 5 weeks.
The details about the topics discussed in 5 of the classes.
This was organised and funded by Chaincode.

* [curriculum](./curriculum/)

This is a section which tries to explain core rust topics and concepts concisely.
It contains a list of modules and each module has a list of topics.
These are the reading materials for the students to go through before they appear for the live class.
Students will be allocated certain topics and questions and are expected to explain those to their
fellow students clearly.

* [bitcoin_in_rust](./bitcoin_in_rust/)

This is a WIP where I'm trying to build simplified bitcoin from scratch.
Purpose is to understand the design of bitcoin intuitively using rust.
This is not going to be like "Programming bitcoin", but more like "Grokking Bitcoin with Rust".

* [c_and_rust](./c_and_rust/)

I volunteered for the participants of a Chaincode cohort to teach Rust and how it solves
the problems faced when programming using C.
Here the topics are discussed in depth, discussions included computer architecture and operating systems.

* [blockchain_analysis](./blockchain_analysis/)

This is a cargo project where I build programs to analyze various aspects of bitcoin blockchain using
bitcoin related crates.

* [tutorials](./tutorials/)

This section contains how to do specific bitcoin related activities using rust.

* [cmd_wallet](//cmd_wallet/)

This is a WIP where I try to create a command line bitcoin wallet for learning purposes.
