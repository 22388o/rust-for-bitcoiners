# About this repo

This is a collection of my teaching works based on the past live classes I teach
and tutorials.
The theme is "Rust for Bitcoiners", so the examples are created in such a way that
it is relevant to Bitcoin technology.

The purpose of the top level directories are explained below.

* [rust-for-bitcoiners-1](./rust-for-bitcoiners-1/)

This directory contains the details about first run of the live classes spanning over 5 weeks.
The details about the topics discussed in 5 of the classes.
This was organised and funded by Chaincode.

* [curriculum](./curriculum/)

This is where I write down tutorials to understand rust programming language from
my perspective.

* [bitcoin_in_rust](./bitcoin_in_rust/)

This is a WIP where I'm trying to build simplified bitcoin from scratch.
Purpose is to understand the design of bitcoin intuitively using rust.
This is not going to be like "Programming bitcoin", but more like "Grokking Bitcoin with Rust".

* [c_and_rust](./c_and_rust/)

I volunteered for the participants of a Chaincode cohort to teach Rust and how it solves
the problems faced when programming using C.
Here the topics are discussed in depth, discussions included computer architecture and operating systems.

* [blockchain_analysis](./blockchain_analysis/)

This is a cargo project where I build programs to analyze various aspects of bitcoin blockchain using
bitcoin related crates.

* [tutorials](./tutorials/)

Here I explain in depth how to implement bitcoin related things in rust. For example,
it contains tutorials on how I created certain functionalities in [blockchain_analysis](./blockchain_analysis/).

* [cmd_wallet](//cmd_wallet/)

This is a WIP where I try to create a command line bitcoin wallet for learning purposes.
